<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Art has always been my passion: creating moving and thought provoking experiances for viewers. I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a bachlors in Craft and Materials Studies. This allowed me to explore the physical world of art. But, more importantly, I learned to find the art in practical objects and the precision to make an art object with a job.</p>

<p> Web development is incredibly similar. What I do is to create a world for my users to experiance, one that touches them deeply, expressing exactly the information and emotions I wish to convey. But also one that is deeply practical. The bottom line is no matter how exciting the idea, it just has to work.</p>

<p>I live with my two best friends and our three cats: Lumos, Lily, and Mr. Noodles in Baltimore, Maryland. My favorite activities include cosplay, reading manga, and playing TTRPGS. I have an embarssing amount of dice!</p>
